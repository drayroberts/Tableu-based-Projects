# Tableu-based-Projects
The files shared here are samples of work I've done in Tableau, usually in meeting degree requirements. Each file is a packaged workbook with data extracted, so anyone can download and reproduce my visuals.

All projects hosted here are also available on my Tableau public profile at https://public.tableau.com/profile/damon.roberts3151#!/
